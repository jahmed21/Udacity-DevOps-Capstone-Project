Note: After configuring your root MySQL user to authenticate with a password, youâ€™ll no longer be able to access MySQL with the sudo mysql command used previously. Instead, you must run the following:

mysql -u root -p
After entering the password you just set, you will see the MySQL prompt.

At this point, your database system is now set up and you can move on to installing PHP.
